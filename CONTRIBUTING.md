# Contributing Guidelines

## Setup

### Install git
For instructions see https://git-scm.com/.

### Fork the project
Go to https://github.com/drageelr/manim-data-structures and click the "fork" button.

### Clone your fork
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/manim-data-structures.git
```
Once your fork is cloned, change the directory to enter the project folder:
```bash
cd manim-data-structures
```

### Add upstream repository
```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/drageelr/manim-data-structures.git
```
Now, `git remote -v` should show two remotes:
* `origin`: Your forked repository.
* `upstream`: The Manim Data Structures repository

### Install dependencies
* Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) by following the instructions on this [link](https://python-poetry.org/docs/master/#installing-with-the-official-installer).
* Run `poetry install` inside the fork directory to install all dependencies. This command also creates a virtual environment which you can later enter by running `poetry shell` from within the forked directory.
* Install pre-commit by running `poetry run pre-commit install`. This ensures that each commit is properly formatted against the linters `black`, `flake8` and `isort`.

## Development

### Fetch the latest code from upstream
```bash
git checkout dev
git pull upstream dev
git push origin dev
```

### Initiate a PR
Once you have finalized your contribution, navigate to this [link](https://github.com/drageelr/manim-data-structures/pulls) to create a new pull request and submit it.

### Closing note
Once your PR is approved, it will be merged into the `dev` branch and eventually your contribution will make it through to the next release.

Thanks for contributing üòÅ!
